# Vulnerability Disclosures
[Description]
Our vision is an open source software ecosystem where the time to fix a vulnerability and deploy that fix across the ecosystem is measured in minutes, not months. 

# Motivation
[TBD]
What is to be achieved with this intiative?

# Objectives
(CY 2020)

1.) Identifying vulnerability disclosure pain points for OSS maintainers, consumers, and reporter/finders and take steps to address them through techniques like automation and standardized data formats.

2.) Documenting and promoting reasonable vulnerability disclosure and coordination practices within the OSS ecosystem for component maintainers and community members by providing documented standards and educational materials.

3.) Facilitate the development and adoption of standards-based OSS Vulnerability information that uses existing industry formats. and allows OSS projects of all sizes to be able to report, share, and learn about vulnerabilities within OSS components.
