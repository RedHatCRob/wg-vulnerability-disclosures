# Vulnerability Disclosures

Our vision is an open source software ecosystem where the time to fix a vulnerability and deploy that fix across the ecosystem is measured in minutes, not months. 

## Objectives and Key Results (CY 2020)

The first objectives we're using to track our progress towards that vision are:

- Create a unified format and API for vulnerability reporting (from researchers to maintainers) and drive broad adoption of it across the open source software ecosystem
- Create a unified format, API, and process for coordinated disclosure (from maintainers to users/the world) and drive broad adoption

## Outputs

- [Unified list of metadata for vulnerability reports and disclosures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZpBk2aIup29KcWwN5MAhvkk60EE_DRt2YRtLo8P0zs/edit?usp=sharing)
- Meeting notes are in [this repository](docs/meeting-notes)

# Governance

The [CHARTER.md](CHARTER.md) outlines the scope and governance of our group activities.
